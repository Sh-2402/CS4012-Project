          <!-- Placeholder description for now -->
          <p>Fernando de Noronha is an archipelago off the coast of northeastern Brazil, part of the state of Pernambuco and with a population of around 3100.
            It is known for its stunning natural beauty, including volcanic landscapes, clear turquoise water and breathtaking beaches. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a must-go destination for those who love marine life, seeking for an unique eco-tourism experience.

          <h3>Culture</h3>
          <p>
            The archipelago was discovered in 1503, then becoming Brazil's first Donatary Captaincy. After it was abandoned by its donatary, the island suffered many attacks from pirates, having been occupied by the Dutch from 1629 to 1654 and by the French from 1736 to 1737.
            In 1737, Portugal took back control of the island, which was then turned into a Penal Colony (prison) for common prisioners from Pernambuco and later on for political prisioners as well. <br><br>
            It was not until 1988 when Fernando de Noronha was incorporated back into the state of Pernambuco and Fernando de Noronha's National Marine Park was created, which contributed to the island becoming a famous touristic destination.
